# Summer Work2017
This is the master directory for all the work we will be doing this summer. 

Read up on how github works first before using this, and get gitkraken so you can sync files simply. Gitkraken seems super powerfull, so be sure you know what you are doing before you do it. 

Also, make branches for everything. Wanna keep this shit clean. 

*HAVE FUN*
